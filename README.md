Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Statement of business task:

Identify the differences in the use of Cyclistic between casual and member riders in order to launch a marketing campaign aimed to casual riders that allows them convert into member riders.

### Data sources used:

1) I downloaded the records available by Cyclistic from August 2021 to July 2022 and  stored them on the hard drive disk (HDD) of my computer.
2) I used SQL Server to join the twelve files (one per each month of year) into one unique dataset. Before this step, it was necessary to change data type from certain columns.
3) The data used in this analysis are only for academic purposes. Apparently, data belongs to Clyclistic, but there is no way to confirm that since it is public. 
4) The data used in this analysis is enough to stand out main differences between casual and member riders behavior. 
5) When I sorted and filtered the table I realized that there are many rows showing NULL values. 

### Data cleaning and manipulation:
